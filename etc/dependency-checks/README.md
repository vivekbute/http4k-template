# Dependency Checks

This is an automated build for checks against dependencies of the codebase, using
the [Gradle Versions plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin/).

See [Gradle Version Reporter](https://github.com/springernature/docker-images/tree/master/gradle-versions-reporter) for details.
